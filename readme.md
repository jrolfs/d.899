d.899 is an Electron based key mapping utility. This is a work in progress, the
initial use case is to attempt to regain my precious `fn` + `h``j``k``l` vim
direction bindings in macOS Sierraâ„¢.

The vim direction use case will serve as an initial proof of concept. If
resource consumption of the Electron background process is deemed acceptable
and there is value in extending this functionality to something customizable I
will continue to build this out with a user interface. Otherwise, I'll be
waiting for [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements).
