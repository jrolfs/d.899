d.899 is an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) based key mapping
utility. This is a work in progress, the initial use case is to attempt to
regain my precious `fn` + `h` `j` `k` `l` vim direction bindings in macOS
Sierraâ„¢.

The vim direction use case will serve as an initial proof of concept. If
resource consumption of the Electron background process is deemed acceptable
and there is value in extending this functionality to something customizable I
will continue to build this out with a user interface. Otherwise, I'll be
waiting for [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements).
